title: Entity Access Matrix
description: >
  This matrix dictates which API operations should enforce access control
  upon which entities.

  It's structured in following layers:
    1. API name,
    2. access requirement,
    3. entity name,
    4. list of operations which should enforce access control to this entity
       under this requirement.

  The "mandatory" access implies that a corresponding entity MUST be present
  in the operation context in input. On the other hand, the "discretionary"
  access implies that a corresponding entity MAY NOT be present in the
  operation context and if so the policy will not be enforced.

  The "universal" access requirement marks operations which are exempt from
  access control (i.e. universally allowed). Since there are no entities to
  enforce access for, such list is not split by entity names.

  The "restricted" access implies that a corresponding entity MAY BE restricted
  in context of given API. Right now policy expects that restrictions will list
  all possible entities that can be worked on with given context, so that
  filtering of said entities can be performed by relevant API implementations.
